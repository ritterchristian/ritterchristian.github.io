<h1>McAfee Knob</h1>

<p>McAfee Knob is an 8.3 mile hike in Catawba, Virginia, about 45 minutes out from Blacksburg and Virginia Tech. It's one of the most popular and photographed hikes not only in Southwest Virginia but also on the whole Appalachian Trail. So, don't be surprised to see a lot of people when you're hiking, especially if the weather's nice!</p>
<p>Parking: If you're on VA-311 coming from VA-785 N, the parking lot will be about 1.5 up the road on the right. From the parking lot, the trail to start the hike will be across the street. *Watch out while you're crossing the street... Cars can be going very quickly around the bends.*</p>

<p>The beginning of the trail is fairly steep and rocky (see pic above) but it's a lot of fun to climb around on all the rocks.</p>

<p>As McAfee Knob is part of the Appalachian Trail, there is a shelter a few miles into the hike where thru-hikers of the AT can rest and sleep. When I took this picture in the fall of 2015, a hiker said she had seen a bear at the shelter the previous week!</p>

<p>After a fairly long but not too difficult of a hike, you'll finally get to the famous knob. Directly across you'll see Tinker Cliffs (which is another great hike that I recommend), some farms and fields below, and you can see Roanoke if you look far enough right.</p>

<p>Here's another pic of the knob, but this one was taken at a sunrise in summer 2015. I can definitely see why this is one of the most photographed hikes of Virginia, especially in the early lights of the morning.
